# Project Description:
Business Forecast is a predictive analytics platform that empowers users to upload datasets, specify parameters, and generate accurate forecasts for informed decision-making.
With its user-friendly interface, customizable features, and AI integration, it provides a versatile solution for businesses aiming for operational excellence.

# Problem Statement:
How can we leverage AI to accurately predict future trends and numbers in real-world data, providing users with actionable insights through intuitive visualizations?

# Intended Users:
Data analysts, researchers, and decision-makers across various industries seek to anticipate trends and make informed decisions based on predictive analytics.

# The Solution/Idea:
Our solution is a service designed to analyze historical data provided in CSV format, along with additional user inputs such as the cycle and prediction period. 
Through advanced AI modelling, these inputs are processed to generate predictive data. 
The service then produces predictive charts and offers textual insights on both the current and forecasted data, enhancing understanding and decision-making.

# Value Proposition & Business Model:
Our AI predictive analytics service utilizes advanced AI techniques, including GenAI, to deliver highly accurate predictions and actionable insights. 
We differentiate ourselves by combining cutting-edge technology with intuitive interfaces, customizable solutions, and ongoing innovation, ensuring precision and relevance for our users' decision-making needs.

# Future Work:
- Increase the number of columns the model will implement the forecasting prediction on.
- Automate the insight for each plot.
- Add the ability for the user to go further in asking more questions about the plot or the insight.
